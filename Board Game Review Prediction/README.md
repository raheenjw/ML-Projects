## Project Overview
In this project, a dataset of about 81312 rows and 20 columns was given regarding the reviews of various board games available. A supervised machine learning model 
will be trained and evaluated to predict the ratings given to a particular board game based on several features of the datasets. Supervised machine learning models like
linear regression and decision trees will be used.

## Data Overview
In this project the dataset that is being used is obtained from the GitHub repository mentioned below. The repository was cloned using Git. The games.csv file contains all

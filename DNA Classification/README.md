## Introduction
DNA promoter has been proven to be the primary cause of many human diseases, especially diabetes and cancer. Therefore, classifying promoters has become an interesting problem
and it has attracted the attention of a lot of researchers in the bioinformatics field. 

## Project Overview
This project is based on classifying DNA sequences as promoter or non promoter using various Machine Learning tecniques such as:
- KNN
- MLP Classifier
- Decision trees and Random Forests
- Naive Bayes
- SVC

## Data Overview
This project will use a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that has 106 DNA sequences, with 57 sequential nucleotides (“base-pairs”) each. 
The dataset can be downloaded from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/molecular-biology/promoter-gene-sequences/

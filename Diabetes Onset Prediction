##Introduction
Data mining and machine learning is helping medical professionals make diagnosis easier by bridging the gap between huge data sets and human knowledge.
We can begin to apply machine learning techniques for classification in a dataset that describes a population that is under a high risk of the onset of diabetes.
Given the medical data we can gather about people, we should be able to make better predictions on how likely a person is to suffer the onset of diabetes,
and therefore act appropriately to help. We can start analyzing data and experimenting with algorithms that will help us study the onset of diabetes in Pima Indians.

##Data Overview
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.The population for this study was the Pima Indian population near
Phoenix, Arizona. The population has been under continuous study since 1965 by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases because of its
high incidence rate of diabetes. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database.
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
The dataset  can be downloaded from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

We have 768 instances and the following 8 attributes:
- Number of times pregnant
- Glucose concentration
- Diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg 
- Triceps skin fold thickness in mm 
- 2-Hour serum insulin in mu U/ml 
- Body mass index measured as weight in kg/(height in m)^2 
- Diabetes pedigree function (pedi)
- Age in years (age)
